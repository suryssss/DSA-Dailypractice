Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
0 <= k <= nums.length

solution:

        i=0
        zc=0
        ml=0
        for j in range(len(a)):
            if a[j]==0:
                zc+=1
            if zc>k:
                if a[i]==0:
                    zc-=1
                i+=1
            if zc<=k:
                ml=max(ml,j-i+1)
        return ml
