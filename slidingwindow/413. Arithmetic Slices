An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

For example, [1,3,5,7,9], [7,7,7,7], and [3,-1,-5,-9] are arithmetic sequences.
Given an integer array nums, return the number of arithmetic subarrays of nums.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: We have 3 arithmetic slices in nums: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1,2,3,4] itself.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000

solution:


        if len(a)<3:
            return 0

        c=0
        i=0
        d=a[1]-a[0]
        for j in range(2,len(a)):
            if a[j]-a[j-1]==d:
                c+=1
                i+=c
            else:
                d=a[j]-a[j-1]
                c=0
        return i
