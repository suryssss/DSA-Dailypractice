Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most one element.

We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for every i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2).

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,2,1]
Output: false
Explanation: You cannot get a non-decreasing array by modifying at most one element.
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105

solution:
        a=len(n)
        c=0
        for i in range(1,a):
            if n[i-1]>n[i]:
                c+=1
                if c>1:
                    return False
                if i-2>=0 and n[i-2]>n[i]:
                    n[i]=n[i-1]
                else:
                    n[i-1]=n[i]
        return True
