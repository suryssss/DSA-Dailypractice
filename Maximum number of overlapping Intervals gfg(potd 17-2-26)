You are given an array of intervals arr[][], where each interval is represented by two integers [start, end] (inclusive). Return the maximum number of intervals that overlap at any point in time.

Input: arr[][] = [[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 6]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum overlapping intervals are 2(between (1, 2) and (2, 4) or between (2, 4) and (3, 6))

Intution:
take two arrays as start as end sorted one iterate over them compare the start[i] and end[j] if u get an interval increase the count and calculate max_overlap if not decrement the count

Solution:

    def overlapInt(self, arr):
        # code here
        n=len(arr)
        start=sorted(i[0] for i in arr)
        end=sorted(i[1] for i in arr)
        
        i=0
        j=0
        curr=0
        max_overlap=0
        
        while i<n and j<n:
            if start[i]<=end[j]:
                curr+=1
                max_overlap=max(curr,max_overlap)
                i+=1
            else:
                curr-=1
                j+=1
        return max_overlap
